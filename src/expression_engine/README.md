# Expression Datamodel

This module implements a fast and simple W3C-SCXML Datamodel.
It an expression-like, non-Turing-complete language. 

It is available if feature _"RfsmExpressionModel"_ is turned on.

### Selection of Datamodel

To select this model in SCXML use `datamodel="rfsm-expression"`. 

### Syntax (_DRAFT_)

```
  <expression-list>  ::= <expression> {";" <expression>}
  <expression>       ::= <sub-expression> [<operator> <expression>]
  <sub-expression>   ::= {"!"}<data>{ "." <method> | "." <identifier> | <index-expression> }
  <data>             ::= <method> | <identifier> | <constant>
  <method>           ::= <identifier> "(" <arguments> ")"
  <index-expression> ::= "[" <sub-expression> "]"
  <constant>         ::= "null" | <map> | <array> | <boolean> | <string> | <number>
  <map>              ::= "{" [<map-field>{ "," <map-field> } ] "}"
  <map-field>        ::= <sub-expression> ":" <sub-expression>
  <array>            ::= "[" <arguments> "]"
  <boolean>          ::= "true" | "false"
  
  <number>           ::= <integer> <fraction> <exponent>
  <integer>          ::= ["-"]( <digit_wo_zero>{<digit>} | <digit> ) 
  <fraction>         ::= "" | "."<digit>{<digit>}
  <exponent>         ::= "" | ("E"|"e")[+|-]<digit>{<digit>}
  <digit_wo_zero>    ::= "1" .. "9"  
  <digit>            ::= "0" | <digit_wo_zero>  

  <string>           ::= '"' { <character> } '"' | "'" { <character> } "'"
  <character>        ::= As specified in JSON: unicode character. '"', "'", '\' and control characters escaped. 
  <arguments>        ::= [ <sub-expression>{"," <sub-expression>} ]
  <identifier>       ::= <letter>{<letter>|<digit>}
  <operator>         ::= "?=" | "=" | "==" | ">=" | "<=" | "*" | "%" | "+" | "-" | ":" | "/" | "&" | "|"
  <letter>           ::= "A" .. "Z" | "a" .. "z" | "_"  
```

Numbers are represented as specified in JSON.

The expressions will be authored as part of the SCXML document, here the encoding of the XML document is used.
The XML parser will convert all text into the encoding of the RUST-runtime. We expect RUST will stick to utf-8,
so the effective structure of a string in the runtime will be utf-8-encoded.<br/>
The structure of such strings is therefore not always identical to the XML source. 
In particular, the length and the individual characters can be different. 
Keep this in mind when performing string operations.   

### Operators

The available operators and their meaning

| Operator             | Name           | Description                                                                                                          |
|----------------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `=`                  | Assignment     | The result of the right side is assigned to the left side. Left side must specify an existing writable variable.     |
| `?=`                 | Initialisation | The left side is created and initialized with the result of the right side. Left side specifies a writable variable. |                                                 |
| `==`                 | Equal          | Results to `true` if the left side is equal to the right side.                                                       |
| `!=`                 | Not Equal      | Results to `true` if the left side is _not_ equal to the right side.                                                 |
| `>=`, `<=`, `>`, `<` | Comparison     | Results to `true` if left and right satisfies the condition.                                                         |
| `/`, `:`             | Division       | Works only on numeric types. Returns a Data::Double.                                                                 |
| `*`                  | Multiplication | Works only on numeric types. Returns a Data::Double if at least one operant is Double, otherwise Data::Integer.      |
| `+`                  | Aggregation    | Computes the sum for Data::Integer or Data::Double and the aggregation for Data::Map and Data::Array.                |
| `-`                  | Minus          | Computes the difference of left and right. Works only on numeric types.                                              |
| `%`                  | Modulus        | Computes the remainder of dividing left by right. Works only on numeric types.                                       |

As mentioned above, the "+" operator aggregates arrays and maps.

If the first operant is an `Data::Array` the second operant will be added to the resulting array. 
If the second operant is also some array, both will be merged. <br/>
The following expression will return _true_:
```
    ['a'] + ['b'] + 'c' == ['a','b'] + ['c']
```

If the first operant is an `Data::Map` (which represents objects),
the second operant must be also a `Data::Map`, as we can't add elements without a name.<br/>
The following expression will return _true_:
```
    {'b':'abc'} + {'a':123} == {'a':123, 'b':'abc'}
```
Due to the nature of maps, identical fields are overwritten by a merge:

```
    {'a':1} == {'a':2} + {'a':1}
```

SCXML requires that only declared variables can be written. An `=` to an undefined variable will return an error.
Nevertheless, it should  be possible to declare variables in the global &lt;script&gt; element.<br/>
In the ECMA-datamodel (in which the ECMA-interpreter is executed in strict mode) this is done via a _"var"_ declaration. <br/>
This expression language is not a script languages and thus has no such declaration syntax. Instead, you can use the "Initialisation" assignment operator `?=` 
to create and initialize a variable.<br/>

```
  myVar ?= [1,2,3,4]
```

SCXML aldo requires that system variables are read-only. To support this, the Datamodel has a "readonly" flag in each data-element. 
Assignments to a read-only marked data will fail. <br/>
There is currently no way to set this flag from the expression language. 


### Custom Actions

Custom actions via the trait "Action" can be called like methods.

_You can call them like global functions_

```
  length("a string")
```

_Or you can call them like member-functions_<br/>
In this case, the value on which this action is called is given as first argument.
This works for all actions with at least one argument.

```
  "a string".length()
```

There are several pre-defined Actions:

| Action    | Arguments                                                                                                                                                                                          | Return Type   | Description                                                                                         |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| abs       | One argument of type <ul><li>Data::Double</li><li>Data::Integer</li></ul>                                                                                                                          | Same as input | Computes the absolute value.                                                                        |
| length    | One argument of type <ul><li>Data::String - number of characters</li><li>Data::Array - number of items</li><li>Data::Map - number of entries</li><li>Data::Source - number of characters</li></ul> | Data::Integer | Get the length of the argument.                                                                     |
| isDefined | One argument of any kind.                                                                                                                                                                          | Data::Boolean | Technical, this checks if the argument is not `Data::Error` or `Data::None`.                        |
| indexOf   | Two arguments of type Data::String.                                                                                                                                                                | Data::Integer | Get the index of the second string inside the first one. Returns -1, if the string was not found.   |
| In        | One argument of type Data::String.                                                                                                                                                                 | Data::Boolean | Implements SCXML "In" function. Returns _true_, if the given state is in the current configuration. |

### Control Structures 

This Expression Language has no control-structures like a script language.<br/>
For If/For/While constructs use the SCXML Executable Content elements with this functionality.
